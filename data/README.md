## Dataset #1: Point-in-Time Estimates by Continuum of Care (2007-2020) 
Description: The Point-in-Time Count is conducted once a year to identify the number of sheltered and unsheltered individuals experiencing homelessness across the United States on any given night. The Department of Housing and Urban Development requires all Continuums of Care (CoCs; local collaboratives of homeless assistance programs and organizations) to submit their data by the end of January. This dataset includes estimates of the number of individuals experiencing homelessness and their demographic characteristics by CoC region from 2007 to 2020.
