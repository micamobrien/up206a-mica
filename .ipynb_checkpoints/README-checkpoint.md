## Repo URL and Intro

### Profile
My name is Mica O’Brien and I am a first year MURP in CEDH. I’m originally from Washington DC, where I was living for the past 3 years before moving to LA. I am currently living in Palms. I became obsessed with housing in college when I took a (slightly random) internship at a supportive housing organization based in New York City. I think housing policy is fascinating because it exposes deep-seeded issues in American life (racial, ethnic, and socio-economic inequality and discrimination, etc.) and, in my opinion, is central to their solutions. Since college I've worked at various advocacy and research organizations on issues of housing and homelessness, social services, and food insecurity. 

### Course Description and Personal Objectives 
In this course, we will explore various data science tools, become familiar with programming in Python, and contend with urban planning issues through data visualizations and analysis. We will gain skills to work with and present data to inform urban policy. I look forward to gaining confidence in my coding abilities and understanding and using data in new ways. 

### Project Ideas
In terms of project ideas, I am interested in exploring the intersection of affordable housing and homelessness and other social issues such as food and job insecurity and transit access. My background is in federal housing programs, so I would also be interested in understanding the spatial overlap of subsidized housing and other social welfare benefits (i.e. SNAP or TANF recipients, schools with high numbers of students receiving free or reduced lunch, etc.). That said, I am open to exploring other issues/phenomena outside of housing as well. I am really looking forward to this quarter :grinning:
